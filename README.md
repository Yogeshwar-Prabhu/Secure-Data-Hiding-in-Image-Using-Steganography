## **Key Features**

- üèûÔ∏è **Supports PNG, JPG, and BMP formats** for broad compatibility.  
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Enter text manually** or üìÑ **load from a file** for convenience.  
- üîë **Secure encoding & decoding** with password protection.  
- üé® **Dark-themed modern UI** for an enhanced visual experience.  
- üìü **Real-time status updates** to track encoding & decoding progress.  
- ‚ö° **Optimized performance** for lightning-fast message processing.  
- üñºÔ∏è **Preserves image quality** while embedding secret messages.  

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yogeshwar-Prabhu/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

1. Run the application:
```bash
python Steganography.py
```

2. To encode a message:
   - Click "Select Image" to choose your carrier image
   - Enter your secret message or use "Load from File" to load from a text file
   - Enter a password for security
   - Click "Encode Message"
   - Choose where to save the encoded image

3. To decode a message:
   - Select the encoded image
   - Enter the password used during encoding
   - Click "Decode Message"
   - The hidden message will appear in the output section

## **Technical Details**

The application uses the following techniques:
- LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography
- Password-based message protection
- Custom pixel manipulation using OpenCV
- Message length preservation in image metadata

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Tkinter (included with Python)
